To convert it to a React App
By doing these steps:
To set up a React app, you need to install Node.js and create a new React project using a tool like Create React App. Next, you should divide your HTML into components and move your CSS to a separate file. Then, you can convert your existing JavaScript code into React components, add React-specific features like state management and event handling, and test your React app. Finally, once you're happy with your React app, you can deploy it to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS.
